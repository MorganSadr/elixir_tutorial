# KV

This application is a noddy app created by following the elixir tutorial.

I've just been looking into elixir and wanted to follow the guide, with a finished app I can reference when I'm done.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `kv` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:kv, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/kv](https://hexdocs.pm/kv).
